# React-Router Verification Tasks

- [x] Search for react-router usage in the project
- [x] Read and analyze src/App.tsx for routing setup
- [x] Read and analyze src/shared/Header/Links.tsx for navigation links
- [x] Check package.json for react-router-dom dependency
- [x] Verify path generation consistency between routes and links
- [x] Check for potential issues (keys, error handling, etc.)
- [x] Run development server to ensure no build errors
- [x] Complete verification based on code analysis (browser testing skipped due to tool limitations)
